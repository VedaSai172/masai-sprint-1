                </dt>
                <dd><strong>Yogi Bear</strong> is an anthropomorphic funny animal who has appeared in numerous comic books, animated television shows and films. He made his debut in 1958 as a supporting character in The Huckleberry Hound Show.</dd>
                <dd><strong>Yogi Bear</strong> was the first breakout character in animated television; he was created by Hanna-Barbera and was eventually more popular than Huckleberry Hound.In January 1961, he was given his own show, The Yogi Bear Show, sponsored by Kellogg's, which included the segments Snagglepuss and Yakky Doodle.Hokey Wolf replaced his segment on The Huckleberry Hound Show.A musical animated feature film, Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!, was released in 1964.</dd>
                <dd><strong>Yogi Bear</strong> was one of several Hanna-Barbera characters to have a collar. This allowed animators to keep his body static, redrawing only his head in each frame when he spokeâ€”one of the methods used by Hanna-Barbera to cut costs by reducing the number of drawings needed for a seven-minute cartoon from around 14,000 to around 2,000.</dd>

            <h3>Voice Actors</h3>
            <p>From the time of the character's debut until 1988, Yogi was voiced by voice actor Daws Butler. Butler died in 1988; his last performance as Yogi was in the television film Yogi and the Invasion of the Space Bears.
                After Butler's death, Greg Burson stepped in to perform the role; Butler had taught Burson personally how to voice Yogi as well as his other characters. Worsening alcoholism and a legal incident led to Burson's firing in 2004 and eventually his death in 2008.</p>
